This document describes issues in Clang and OpenCL drivers that we
have encountered while developing the WebCL Validator.

OpenCL Drivers
==============

This section describes OpenCL driver related compiler and run-time
issues. Refer to TESTING.txt for more detailed test equipment setups.

OpenCL Compiler Differences
---------------------------

We have seen some differences in OpenCL drivers. These aren't bugs,
the differences just illustrate how different vendors interpret the
OpenCL specification either more strictly or more loosely. Each of the
cases below are accepted by some drivers, but rejected by at least one
driver.

Issue C1: Intel compiler doesn't support "__local int array[]" as
          function parameter, because OpenCL specification doesn't
          require that. One needs to use "__local int *array" instead.
Workaround: The validator could transform "array[]" to "*array".

Issue C2: AMD compiler doesn't like "size_t" types as kernel
          parameters.
Workaround: The validator uses "ulong" when it needs to generate size
            parameters for memory objects. The validator could
            transform "size_t" to "ulong" for other kernel parameters.

Issue C3: AMD compiler doesn't allow you to index vectors as in
          uint4 v; v[0] = 0;
          because the OpenCL specification doesn't require that.
Workaround: The validator could transform "v[0]" to "v.x". The
            validator could emit an error message for "v[i]".

Issue C4: AMD compiler doesn't allow you to access vector fields with
          a pointer, because the OpenCL specification doesn't require
          that. You need to use "uint4 *p = &v; (*p).x = 0;" instead
          of "p->x = 0;".
Workaround: The validator could transform "p->x" to "(*p).x".

Issue C5: Apple compiler requires prototype declarations for each
          helper function.
Workaround: To avoid warnings, the validator could make each helper
            function static, or generate a prototype for them. Minor
            issue that could be ignored.

Issue C6: Apple compiler gives warnings on e.g. signed vs. unsigned
          comparisons.
Workaround: Minor issue that could be ignored.

OpenCL Compiler Bugs
--------------------

Issue B1: AMD compiler segfaults if array is indexed with
          "index[array]" instead of "array[index]".
Workaround: The validator transforms both forms to "*(array + index)".

Issue B2: AMD compiler segfaults if structure initialization refers to
          itself:
          __constant struct { int v; __constant int *p; } c = { 0, &c.v };
Workaround: ?

Issue B3: AMD compiler segfaults if kernel contains nothing but a
          single barrier call:
          __kernel void dummy(int d) { barrier(CLK_LOCAL_MEM_FENCE); }
Workaround: It's unlikely that anyone wants to use this kind of kernel
            in practice.

Issue B4: POCL compiler requires kernel called 'main' to return int
          instead of void. This is a general problem with Clang based
          tools, since OpenCL support is not complete in Clang.
Workaround: ?

Issue B5: POCL compiler may crash when structure pointers are cast to
          character pointers in function call arguments. This is
          required in check-empty-memory test where address space
          limits are passed to local memory initialization
          routine. AMD and Intel compilers work fine.
Workaround: Sometimes casting indirectly via pointers to larger types
            may help, but not always. For example, type* -> char* may
            crash but type* -> int* -> char* may work.

Issue B6: Intel compiler crashes when the validated version of test
          case "remove-variables.cl" is compiled.
Workaround: ?

OpenCL Driver Bugs
------------------

We have also found nasty run-time bugs in OpenCL drivers. For this
reason we suggest that Intel or POCL driver is used for now as the
binary drivers of some hardware vendors seem to cause a lot of
problems.

Issue D1: POCL 0.8 driver doesn't support image3d_t.
Workaround: The validator already rejects image3d_t use because it's
            not supported in WebCL. This is only a minor issue in our
            test cases.

Issue D2: AMD driver compiles and executes our radix-sort test
          case. However, the results are incorrect because certain
          vector variable contents become corrupted when barriers are
          used. At least Intel and POCL drivers produce correct
          results.
Workaround: ?

Issue D3: Apple CPU driver wasn't able to run radix-sort test case at
          all when unsortedValues_ buffer is created with
          CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR. Calling clEnqueueNDRangeKernel() fails
          stating CL_INVALID_WORK_GROUP_SIZE. If the same buffer is
          created with CL_MEM_COPY_HOST_PTR, then running the kernel
          causes CL_OUT_OF_RESOURCES error.
Workaround: ?

Issue D4: Apple i5 CPU driver compilation crashes is local memory 
          zeroing macro is replaced with with following:
          #define WCL_LOCAL_RANGE_INIT(begin, end) for(_local char* cur = (__local char*)begin; cur != (__local char*)end; cur++) { *cur = _WCL_FILLCHAR; }
Workaround: Zeroing is written differently.

Clang
=====

This section describes limitations of Clang regarding OpenCL C
code. We should try to upstream relevant fixes at some point.

Builtin Types
-------------

Not yet fixed locally:
Trunk of Clang supports OpenCL image and event types. Support isn't
present in 3.2. We should import these changes from upstream.

Image Access Qualifiers
-----------------------

Fixed locally, but not in upstream:
Clang parser supports __read_only, __write_only and __read_write image
access qualifiers. However, these qualifiers aren't associated with
types of parameter variable declarations and they are thrown away when
AST is built.

Optional Function Qualifiers
----------------------------

Not yet fixed locally:
The __attribute__((vec_type_hint(<type>))) has been defined but isn't
currently handled properly.

Printing of AST
---------------

These fixes can be abandoned. We don't need them anymore since we have
decided to use Clang's rewriting mechanism instead of printing the AST
with Clang's AST node printers.

Fixed locally, not in upstream:
Image access qualifiers aren't printed, because they are missing from
the AST.

Not yet fixed locally:
The __attribute__((vec_type_hint(<type>))) qualifier isn't printed
because it's missing from the AST.

Fixed locally, not in upstream:
Function qualifiers are printed after function parameters instead of
printing them before the return type.

Fixed locally, not in upstream:
The __kernel qualifier is printed as
__attribute__((opencl_kernel_function)).

Preprocessing
-------------

Fixed locally, not in upstream:
Clang supports a bunch of preprosessor callbacks. This mechanism needs
to be extended with OpenCL extension pragmas.

Array Indexing
--------------

Fixed in validator tool, not in upstream:
Clang doesn't handle indexing of arrays with large integer constant
expressions (>= 2^63) properly.

Static vector initialisers are not working properly in clang 3.2
----------------------------------------------------------------

http://clang-developers.42468.n3.nabble.com/getSourceRange-for-InitListExpr-td4033036.html
Also opened bug report: http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=16560

For now the bug can be circumvented by having vector initializations
wrapped inside parentheses: (float4)(0,0,0,0) -> ((float4)(0,0,0,0)).
